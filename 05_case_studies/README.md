# 05_case_studies

This folder contains **realistic case study SQL tasks** inspired by finance and investment fund operations.  
Unlike basics or single-feature exercises, these case studies **combine multiple SQL features** (filters, aggregations, HAVING, sorting) and simulate scenarios that could occur in professional practice.

## Purpose
- Demonstrate the ability to solve **business-style problems** with SQL.  
- Show practical applications in areas such as fund monitoring, auditor analysis, and NAV checks.  
- Provide queries that resemble the complexity of **Oracle SQL certification** and real finance use cases.

## Approach
- Each `.sql` file represents a **standalone case study**.  
- Case studies are based on the artificial `lux_funds` dataset.  
- Constraints are designed so results are **non-empty** and meaningful.  
- Tasks combine multiple SQL elements to reflect real-life queries.
