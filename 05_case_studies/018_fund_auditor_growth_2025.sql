-- Case Study: Fundâ€“Auditor growth analysis 2025
-- For each (fund_name, auditor) pair in 2025 with importance High or Medium:
-- - Count records
-- - Calculate average growth vs previous_amount
-- - Calculate average estimated growth vs previous_amount
-- - Find maximum growth vs previous_amount
-- Keep only groups with at least 3 records and positive average growth in one of the measures.
-- Return top 10 sorted by max_growth (desc) and rows_count (desc).
