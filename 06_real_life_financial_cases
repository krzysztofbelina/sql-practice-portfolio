# 06 – Real Life Financial Case Studies

This section contains full-scale, operationally realistic SQL reconciliation cases
designed to simulate production fund operations.

Each case demonstrates:
- A clear financial rationale (why the logic matters)
- The use of previously learned SQL functions (COALESCE, CASE, JOIN, etc.)
- Compliance alignment (UCITS / CSSF context)
- Practical output validation (thresholds, variance categorization)

| Case | Description | Focus |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| 01 | Strict vs Mixed NAV Comparison | Data integrity and fallback impact |
| 02 | TBD | – |
| 03 | TBD | – |
