# sql-practice-portfolio
SQL practice tasks for finance and investment funds. Exercises inspired by Oracle SQL certification (intermediate level) and artificial case studies designed to mirror real scenarios that may occur in practice, based on my professional experience in investment funds.
# SQL Portfolio â€“ Finance & Oracle Certification Prep

This repository contains my SQL practice exercises.  
The tasks are based on:
- **Oracle SQL certification** (intermediate level)  
- **Finance & fund accounting use cases**  
- **Artificial case studies** that simulate realistic scenarios which may occur in professional practice, inspired by my own experience in investment funds.  

## Purpose
This repository is created solely for **educational and training purposes**.  
The dataset (`lux_funds` table) is **entirely artificial** and does not represent real financial data.  
The inclusion of common financial institution names (banks, auditors) serves **only to make the exercises more realistic** and relatable to professional SQL use cases in finance.

## Approach

- Commit messages explain the purpose of each task  
- Tasks get progressively more difficult  
- Case studies simulate **real-world finance problems** (NAV checks, reconciliations, fund flows)  
- All exercises reflect scenarios that could realistically occur in finance, based on real industry experience
