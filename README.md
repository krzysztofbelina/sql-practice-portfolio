# SQL Portfolio â€“ Finance & Oracle Certification Prep

SQL practice tasks for finance and investment funds.  
Exercises inspired by Oracle SQL certification (intermediate level) and artificial case studies designed to mirror real scenarios that may occur in practice, based on my professional experience in investment funds.  

---

## Purpose
This repository is created solely for **educational and training purposes**.  
The dataset (`lux_funds` table) is **entirely artificial** and does not represent real financial data.  
The inclusion of common financial institution names (banks, auditors) serves **only to make the exercises more realistic** and relatable to professional SQL use cases in finance.

## Repository Structure
- `01_basics/` â€“ SELECT, WHERE, simple filters  
- `02_aggregations/` â€“ COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, HAVING  
- `03_data_management/` â€“ INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP  
- `04_advanced_filters/` â€“ BETWEEN, IN, NOT IN, LIKE, complex conditions  
- `05_case_studies/` â€“ SQL exercises combining multiple functions and conditions  

---

## Approach
- One `.sql` file = one task + solution  
- Commit messages explain the purpose of each task  
- Tasks get progressively more difficult  
- Case studies simulate **real-world finance problems** (NAV checks, reconciliations, fund flows)  
- All exercises reflect scenarios that could realistically occur in finance, based on real industry experience
