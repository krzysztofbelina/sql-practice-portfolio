# sql-practice-portfolio
SQL practice tasks for finance and investment funds. Exercises inspired by Oracle SQL certification (intermediate level) and artificial case studies designed to mirror real scenarios that may occur in practice, based on my professional experience in investment funds.
# SQL Portfolio â€“ Finance & Oracle Certification Prep

This repository contains my SQL practice exercises.  
The tasks are based on:
- **Oracle SQL certification** (intermediate level)  
- **Finance & fund accounting use cases**  
- **Artificial case studies** that simulate realistic scenarios which may occur in professional practice, inspired by my own experience in investment funds.  

The purpose is to build strong SQL skills for professional use in fintech / investment banking and to prepare for certification exams.
